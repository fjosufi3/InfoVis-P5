Colleges: A Visual Encoding

This project was created as part of our final project in CS 4460. It uses D3 to visualize a dataset of colleges with a number of attributes.

There is a general map view with a set of all colleges displayed as data points. Users are able to interact with the map, along with various other visualization features to explore the dataset.
